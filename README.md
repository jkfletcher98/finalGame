Game Plan/Pitch

Sock Goblins (Pac-man-esque)

The player is trying to collect socks before the sock goblins can steal them. 
Points are awarded for collecting socks. Bonus points for making a pair. 
Collected socks are displayed in an inventory box at the bottom of the screen. If a pair is made, a pair icon appears in the inventory for as few seconds and then is replaced with a "+5" icon. After that the inventory box is empty. 
Socks are generated on the map randomly and are added as time goes on.
Map will be maze-like.
Goblins move on a set path. If they run into a sock, they "pick them up" and the sock disappears. If they run into the player, the player freezes for three seconds
We'll start with a timer (30 seconds) for the player to collect as many socks as possible. May add levels later (would be unlocked if player reaches a point requirement).
