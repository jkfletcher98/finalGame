Game Plan/Pitch

Sock Goblins (Pac-man-esque)

The player is trying to collect socks before the sock goblins can steal them. 
Points are awarded for collecting socks. Bonus points for making a pair. 
Player needs to return collected socks to a laundry basket for points to be counted.
Player can carry up to 5 socks before needing to drop them off. 
Socks are generated on the map randomly and are added as time goes on.
Map will be maze-like.
Goblins move on a set path. If they run into a sock, they "pick them up" and the sock disappears. If they run into the player, they steal the socks the player is holding.
We'll start with a timer (30 seconds) for the player to collect as many socks as possible. May add levels later (would be unlocked if player reaches a point requirement).
