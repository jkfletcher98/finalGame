Character
  init
    assign image
    assign size
    assign postion
    assign moveSpeed to 5
    set walk cycle basics (row, speed, starting column)

  process
    set walking to false
    correction is (0, 0)

    if "w" is pressed
      add moveSpeed to y
      use back walk cycle
      correction (0, -5)
      walking is true
    if "a" is pressed
      subtract moveSpeed from x
      use left walk cycle
      correction (5, 0)
      walking is true
    if "s" is pressed
      subtract moveSpeed from y
      use front walk cycle
      correction (0, 5)
      walking is true
    if "d" is pressed
      add moveSpeed to x
      use right walk cycle
      correction (-5, 0)
      walking is true

    if walking
      use walk animation
    else
      use idle position

    if character collides with wall
      x gets correction(place 0)
      y get correction(place 1)
      walking is false

Goblin
  init
    set image
    set size
    set moveSpeed
    set position
    set walk cycle basics

  process
    correction is (0, 0)

    if y is increasing
      use back walk cycle
      correction (0, -moveSpeed)
    if y is decreasing
      use front walk cycle
      correction (0, moveSpeed)
    if x is increasing
      use right walk cycle
      correction (-moveSpeed, 0)
    if x is decreasing
      use left walk cycle
      correction (moveSpeed, 0)

    if goblin collides with wall
      x gets correction (place 0)
      y get correction (place 1)
      walk cycle changes row
